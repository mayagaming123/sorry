          My heart feels heavy with the weight of my mistake <br />and I canâ€™t escape the sadness it brings.
          You are the light of my life, and now it feels dimmer without your warmth.
I replay the moments that led us here, wishing I could take back the pain I caused.
Like a wilted rose longing for the rain, I long for your forgiveness to bring life back to us.
I am deeply sorry, more than words can express, and I hope you can feel the depth of my regret.
You mean everything to me, and Iâ€™ll do whatever it takes to make things right.<br />Please never say nevermind againðŸ¥º.
